# Pattern 1: Pyramid of Asterisks

## Pattern:
```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints a pyramid of asterisks (`*`) based on the number of rows `n` entered by the user. Each row contains a number of asterisks that increases by one as the row number increases.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number defines the height of the pyramid.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This loop controls the number of rows and repeats `n` times.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j <= i`. This loop prints `* ` for each value of `j`. 
   - The number of asterisks printed in each row is equal to the current row number (`i + 1`).

4. **End of Row:**
   - After each iteration of the inner loop (once all asterisks for that row are printed), the program prints a new line (`cout << endl;`) to start a new row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 0`, prints 1 asterisk.
- **Row 2:** `i = 1`, prints 2 asterisks.
- **Row 3:** `i = 2`, prints 3 asterisks.
- **Row 4:** `i = 3`, prints 4 asterisks.
- **Row 5:** `i = 4`, prints 5 asterisks.

Thus, each row contains an additional asterisk compared to the previous row, forming a pyramid-like structure.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: *
Row 2: * *
Row 3: * * *
Row 4: * * * *
Row 5: * * * * *
```

This creates a left-aligned triangle of increasing asterisks.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern1.cpp -o pattern1
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern1
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```
