# Pattern 0: Rectangular Asterisk Pattern

## Pattern:
```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

## Code Explanation:
This program generates a rectangular pattern made up of asterisks (`*`). The dimensions of the rectangle are defined by the variable `N`, which determines the number of rows and columns of asterisks.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The variable `N` is set to `5`, defining the number of rows and columns of the rectangular pattern. This can be easily modified to create rectangles of different sizes.

2. **Row Generation:**
   - An outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < N`, where each iteration represents a new row.
   - For each row:
     - An inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < N`, printing an asterisk followed by a space (`"* "`).
   
3. **End of Row:**
   - After printing `N` asterisks in a row, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

When the variable `N` is set to `5`, the program will output the following rectangular pattern of asterisks:

```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of the pattern for `N = 5`:

```
Row 1: * * * * *
Row 2: * * * * *
Row 3: * * * * *
Row 4: * * * * *
Row 5: * * * * *
```

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ Pattern0.cpp -o Pattern0
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./Pattern0
   ```

3. The output will display the rectangular pattern of asterisks.

For example, when you run the program, it will display:

```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```
