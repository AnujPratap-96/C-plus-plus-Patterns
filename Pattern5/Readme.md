# Pattern 5: Inverted Pyramid of Numbers

## Pattern:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints an inverted pyramid of numbers, where each row starts from `1` and ends with a number that decreases as the row number increases. The first row contains `n` numbers, and each subsequent row contains one less number than the previous row.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number defines the maximum number of numbers printed in the first row.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = 1` to `i <= n`. This loop controls the number of rows and runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, the number of numbers printed decreases by one as `i` increases.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop runs from `j = 1` to `j <= n - i + 1`. 
   - It prints numbers starting from `1` and increments by `1` until `n - i + 1`. 
   - As the row number increases, the number of printed numbers decreases.

4. **End of Row:**
   - After each iteration of the inner loop, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 1`, prints numbers from `1` to `5`.
- **Row 2:** `i = 2`, prints numbers from `1` to `4`.
- **Row 3:** `i = 3`, prints numbers from `1` to `3`.
- **Row 4:** `i = 4`, prints numbers from `1` to `2`.
- **Row 5:** `i = 5`, prints `1`.

Thus, the pattern forms an inverted pyramid of decreasing numbers.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Row 2: 1 2 3 4
Row 3: 1 2 3
Row 4: 1 2
Row 5: 1
```

This creates an inverted triangle of numbers where each row contains fewer numbers than the previous one.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern5.cpp -o pattern5
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern5
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```
