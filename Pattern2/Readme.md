# Pattern 2: Increasing Number Pyramid

## Pattern:
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints a number pyramid where each row contains an increasing sequence of numbers starting from `1`. The number of elements in each row is equal to the row number.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number determines the height of the number pyramid.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This loop controls the number of rows and executes `n` times.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j <= i`. 
   - The inner loop prints numbers starting from `1` to `i + 1`, incrementing `j + 1` each time.
   - As the row number increases, the inner loop prints one more number than the previous row.

4. **End of Row:**
   - After the inner loop finishes printing the numbers for a row, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 0`, prints numbers from `1` to `1`.
- **Row 2:** `i = 1`, prints numbers from `1` to `2`.
- **Row 3:** `i = 2`, prints numbers from `1` to `3`.
- **Row 4:** `i = 3`, prints numbers from `1` to `4`.
- **Row 5:** `i = 4`, prints numbers from `1` to `5`.

Thus, each row contains an increasing sequence of numbers, forming a pyramid-like structure of numbers.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: 1
Row 2: 1 2
Row 3: 1 2 3
Row 4: 1 2 3 4
Row 5: 1 2 3 4 5
```

This forms an ascending number pyramid.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern2.cpp -o pattern2
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern2
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
