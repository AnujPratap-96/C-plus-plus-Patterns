# Pattern 3: Repeating Row Number Pyramid

## Pattern:
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints a number pyramid where each row consists of the same number repeated, and that number corresponds to the row number. The number of elements in each row equals the row number.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number defines the height of the number pyramid.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This loop controls the number of rows and iterates `n` times.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j <= i`. 
   - The inner loop prints the current row number (`i + 1`) repeatedly for `i + 1` times in each row.

4. **End of Row:**
   - After the inner loop finishes printing the row's numbers, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 0`, prints `1` once.
- **Row 2:** `i = 1`, prints `2` two times.
- **Row 3:** `i = 2`, prints `3` three times.
- **Row 4:** `i = 3`, prints `4` four times.
- **Row 5:** `i = 4`, prints `5` five times.

Thus, each row contains a repeated sequence of the current row number, forming a pyramid-like structure of numbers.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: 1
Row 2: 2 2
Row 3: 3 3 3
Row 4: 4 4 4 4
Row 5: 5 5 5 5 5
```

This creates a repeating number pyramid, where each row is filled with the same number as the row number.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern3.cpp -o pattern3
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern3
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```
