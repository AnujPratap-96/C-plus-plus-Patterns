# Pattern 4: Inverted Pyramid of Asterisks

## Pattern:
```
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints an inverted pyramid of asterisks (`*`), where the number of asterisks decreases as the row number increases. The first row starts with `n` asterisks, and each subsequent row contains one less asterisk than the previous row.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number determines the starting number of asterisks in the first row.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = n` down to `1`. This loop controls the number of rows and runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, the number of asterisks printed decreases by one as `i` decreases.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop runs from `j = i` down to `1`. It prints `*` for each value of `j` within the current row. 
   - The number of asterisks printed in each row corresponds to the current value of `i`.

4. **End of Row:**
   - After each iteration of the inner loop, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to start a new row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 5`, prints 5 asterisks.
- **Row 2:** `i = 4`, prints 4 asterisks.
- **Row 3:** `i = 3`, prints 3 asterisks.
- **Row 4:** `i = 2`, prints 2 asterisks.
- **Row 5:** `i = 1`, prints 1 asterisk.

Thus, the pattern creates an inverted pyramid where the number of asterisks decreases by one in each row.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: * * * * *
Row 2: * * * *
Row 3: * * *
Row 4: * *
Row 5: *
```

This creates an inverted triangle of asterisks that starts wide and becomes narrower with each row.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern4.cpp -o pattern4
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern4
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```
