# Pattern 12: Triangle of Consecutive Numbers

## Pattern:
```
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
```

## Code Explanation:
This program generates a triangular pattern of consecutive numbers. Each row contains an increasing number of numbers, starting from `1` in the first row, continuing to increment across the rows.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The variable `N` is set to `5`, which determines the number of rows in the pattern. This can be adjusted to create patterns of different sizes.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - An outer loop runs from `1` to `N`, where each iteration represents a new row.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - For each row, a nested loop prints numbers starting from `1` and increments up to the current row number (`i`). The variable `num` keeps track of the current number to be printed, ensuring consecutive numbering.

4. **New Line:**
   - After printing the numbers for each row, a new line is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

When the variable `N` is set to `5`, the program will output the following pattern:

```
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
```

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of the pattern for `N = 5`:

```
Row 1:  1 
Row 2:  2 3 
Row 3:  4 5 6 
Row 4:  7 8 9 10 
Row 5:  11 12 13 14 15 
```

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ Pattern12.cpp -o Pattern12
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./Pattern12
   ```

3. The output will display the triangular number pattern.

For example, when you run the program, it will display:

```
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
```
