# C++ Patterns Repository

This repository contains a collection of various C++ programs that generate different patterns using loops. Each pattern is implemented in its own file, and a detailed explanation is provided in individual README files for each pattern.

## Patterns Included:

### 1. **Pattern 1: Right-Angled Triangle of Asterisks**
```

## How to Navigate:

- Each pattern is stored in its respective `.cpp` file.
- You can navigate to a specific pattern by matching the pattern number to its file.
- For example, **Pattern 1** is found in `Pattern1.cpp`, **Pattern 2** in `Pattern2.cpp`, and so on.

### How to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patterns-repo.git
   cd patterns-repo
   ```

2. **Compile and Run a Pattern**:
   - Navigate to the desired pattern file and compile it using a C++ compiler, e.g., g++:
     ```bash
     g++ Pattern1.cpp -o Pattern1
     ./Pattern1
     ```

3. **Adjust the Number of Rows**:
   - In each pattern file, you can modify the value of `N` to change the number of rows in the generated pattern.

### Example:

To run **Pattern 11**, navigate to its directory and compile:
```bash
g++ Pattern11.cpp -o Pattern11
./Pattern11
```

This will generate the following output:
```
1        1
12      21
123    321
1234  4321
12345 54321
```
