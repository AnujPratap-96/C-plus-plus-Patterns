# Pattern 10: Alternating 1s and 0s

## Pattern:
```
   1
   0 1
   1 0 1
   0 1 0 1
   1 0 1 0 1
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints a pattern of alternating `1`s and `0`s in a triangular format. Each row starts with either `1` or `0`, depending on whether the row index is even or odd.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number defines how many rows of the pattern will be printed.

2. **Row Generation:**
   - A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`, where each iteration corresponds to a new row.
   - For each row:
     - The variable `start` is set based on the row index:
       - If `i` is even, `start` is set to `1`.
       - If `i` is odd, `start` is set to `0`.
     - An inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j <= i`, printing either `1` or `0`:
       - The value printed alternates between `1` and `0` based on the current value of `start`, which is toggled after each print.

3. **End of Row:**
   - After printing the values for a row, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

If the user enters `5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
   1
   0 1
   1 0 1
   0 1 0 1
   1 0 1 0 1
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 0`, prints `1` (starting with `1` since `i` is even).
- **Row 2:** `i = 1`, prints `0 1` (starting with `0` since `i` is odd).
- **Row 3:** `i = 2`, prints `1 0 1` (starting with `1` since `i` is even).
- **Row 4:** `i = 3`, prints `0 1 0 1` (starting with `0` since `i` is odd).
- **Row 5:** `i = 4`, prints `1 0 1 0 1` (starting with `1` since `i` is even).

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1:     1
Row 2:    0 1
Row 3:   1 0 1
Row 4:  0 1 0 1
Row 5: 1 0 1 0 1
```

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern10.cpp -o pattern10
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern10
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
   1
   0 1
   1 0 1
   0 1 0 1
   1 0 1 0 1
```
