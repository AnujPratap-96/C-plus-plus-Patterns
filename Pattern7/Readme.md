# Pattern 7: Inverted Right-Aligned Pyramid of Asterisks

## Pattern:
```
* * * * *
 * * * *
  * * *
   * *
    *
```

## Code Explanation:
This program prints an inverted, right-aligned pyramid of asterisks (`*`). The number of asterisks decreases with each row, but the pattern is aligned to the right, creating a straight vertical line on the left edge of the pattern.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input the number of rows (`n`). This number defines the number of asterisks in the first row and the height of the inverted pyramid.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This loop controls the number of rows and runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, the number of spaces increases, and the number of asterisks decreases.

3. **Inner Loops:**
   - **First Inner Loop:** 
     - This loop prints the spaces at the start of each row. It runs from `j = 0` to `j < i`, ensuring that each row is indented with increasing spaces.
   - **Second Inner Loop:**
     - This loop prints the asterisks. It runs from `j = 0` to `j < 2 * (n - i) - 1`, printing a decreasing number of asterisks as `i` increases.

4. **End of Row:**
   - After each iteration of the inner loops, a new line (`cout << endl;`) is printed to move to the next row.

### Example:

If the user enters `n = 5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
* * * * *
 * * * *
  * * *
   * *
    *
```

### Explanation with Rows:

- **Row 1:** `i = 0`, prints 0 spaces followed by 5 asterisks.
- **Row 2:** `i = 1`, prints 1 space followed by 4 asterisks.
- **Row 3:** `i = 2`, prints 2 spaces followed by 3 asterisks.
- **Row 4:** `i = 3`, prints 3 spaces followed by 2 asterisks.
- **Row 5:** `i = 4`, prints 4 spaces followed by 1 asterisk.

Thus, the pattern forms an inverted pyramid that is aligned to the left edge of the output.

### Visual Diagram:

Here is a visual representation of how the pattern is constructed for `n = 5`:

```
Row 1: * * * * *
Row 2:  * * * *
Row 3:   * * *
Row 4:    * *
Row 5:     *
```

This creates an inverted triangle of asterisks where each row contains fewer asterisks than the previous one, aligned to the left.

### How to Run:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ pattern7.cpp -o pattern7
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pattern7
   ```

3. Enter the desired number of rows when prompted.

For example, if you enter `5` as the number of rows, the output will be:

```
Enter the number of rows: 5
* * * * *
 * * * *
  * * *
   * *
    *
```
